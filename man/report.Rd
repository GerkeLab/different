\arguments{
\item{reference}{\code{<tbl>} Reference data frame or tibble}

\item{comparison}{\code{<tbl>} Comparison data frame or tibble}

\item{df_names}{\code{<chr>} Vector of length two containg the names of the data

in the report?}

via \link{plotly}? By default this is \code{FALSE} when saving the report to a
standalone file.}

\item{use_DT}{\code{<lgl>} Should the tables reporting differences be presented as
an interactive datatable with the \link{DT} package? By default this is \code{FALSE}

\describe{
  \item{ignore}{\code{<chr:NULL>} ID column(s) that are ignored from the differencing}
  \item{group_vars}{\code{<chr:ignore>} Column names of grouping variables for alignment,
takes default from \code{ignore}.}
  \item{align}{\code{<lgl:FALSE>} Should alignmment be performed based on the
