Tools for comparing and resolving differences between data frames.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("gerkelab/different@dev")
```

## Demonstration

```{r include=FALSE}
source(here::here("tests/test_data.R"))
x <- example2$x
y <- example2$y
```

Suppose you have two data sets that you would like to compare.

```{r}
x
```

```{r}
y
```

Both have ID columns `id_01` and `id_02`, but we know they will differ in their number of rows and columns and that the rows are unordered.

```{r prompt=TRUE, comment=""}
z <- different::diff_compare(x, y, group_vars = c("id_01", "id_02"))
```

```{r prompt=TRUE, comment=""}
z
```

```{r prompt=TRUE, comment=""}
summary(z)
```

```{r diff_tbl-plot, prompt=TRUE, comment=""}
plot(z)
```

You can also create an HTML document reporting all of the found differences with `diff_report()`.

```r
different::diff_report(x, y, keep_original = TRUE, use_DT = TRUE)
```
